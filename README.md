 Personal Telegram bot

## Working functions:

### Stained glass
Add a stain glass effect to your images by converting them to n clusters! Using the SLIC algorithm, convert your photo into clusters of superpixels to add some character. You decide how many clusters!

Instructions:

- Start this function with /stain
- Choose the number of clusters! You can use the given ones, or input your own integer!
- Send the picture and wait! This works best with images where the subject and background have a higher contrast with one another.

## Future goals:

### Spleeter
Split your audio into vocal and backing track! Made with Spleeter by Deezer. Accepts youtube links and audio files.

- Currently facing issues working with Spleeter

### SG Traffic Watch
Want to check traffic density before leaving the house? Use our Telegram bot to get live updates from traffic cameras all around Singapore!

- Missing conversion from Singapore locations to Long/Lat coordinates (to filter from the LTA input API)
